# ICS_PCAPS
ICS Cybersecurity PCAP repository

This repository includes a series of PCAP captures generated for cybersecurity research purposes. Each capture set is provided as a release, namely:

* [`modbus TCP SCADA #1`](https://github.com/tjcruz-dei/ICS_PCAPS/releases/tag/MODBUSTCP%231) - the entire dataset of network trace captures for paper [1]

This repository will be continuously updated with new traces, as our research effort evolves.

**If you use these trace captures for your own research, we ask you to please cite the corresponding article for which they were generated, in your own publications**
